# _About_
_Note: this repository contains the library for generating Cucumber reports. [Cucumber Forge Desktop](https://github.com/cerner/cucumber-forge-desktop) is a user-friendly desktop application for creating reports with cucumber-forge-report-generator._

The cucumber-forge-report-generator can be used to create clean HTML reports without having to build the project or run the tests. Of course, no pass/fail information for the scenarios is included in the report since the tests are not executed.

Many other solutions exist for creating reports based on the output of Cucumber test runs. The goal of *cucumber-forge-report-generator* is to create reports directly from the feature files without any of the environment/runtime overhead required to build projects and run the Cucumber tests.

# _Usage_

Sample - Generates a report from two feature files with the scenarios filtered by a tag:
```js
const Generator = require('cucumber-forge-report-generator');
const generator = new Generator();
const htmlReportString = generator.generate([filePathString1, filePathString2], 'Project Name', 'TagFilter');
```
Detailed usage documentation can be found [here](https://engineering.cerner.com/cucumber-forge-report-generator/).
